To copy the same environment, the code was running in, I recommend creating a virtual environment. Here are 3 commands on one line (it works at least for macOS):

```python3 -m venv myenv ; source myenv/bin/activate ; pip install numpy scipy pandas matplotlib requests h5py neurokit2```

then we can run the code (python main.py)
